# Colleen Sharp Design

- How’re you going with choosing work?

Yeah good, I was feeling depressed and scared of what I’d find but I found lots of good stuff

And the way I’m arranging my portfolio I can still show some solid old school ads for unsexy clients

Also how I’ve helped a lot of them evolve

It really made me focus in on my niche areas and think about what I do and how I do it

Also part of design is being able to give the client what they want, industry people know that lots of bread and butter clients have their own ideas and not everyone wants hipster stuff… we don’t like to admit it but it’s true

```javascript
portfolioObject = {
    title: "Most important four words",
    excerpt: "Short strapline for underneath title",
    body: "If you've got a lot to say about this one, say it here"
    image: {
        title: "alt tag for this image"
        src: "...filepath.jpg"
    }
}
```
